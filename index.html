            Hey Bug, 
            This was supposed to be something totally different. I originally planned it as a website for Lillie, something for you to remember me by when I’m gone. But now, it’s turned into an apology with flowers because I hurt you, and that’s the last thing I ever wanted to do. I’m so sorry for making you feel sad. 
            I can only imagine how you must be feeling right now, and I want you to know that it was never my intention to upset you in any way. I know it may have seemed like I was ignoring you, but that wasn’t the case at all. I just wanted to finish this before I went to bed, which is why I said I wouldn’t tap out today. 
            I deeply hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. You mean so much to me, and I never want to cause you pain. 
        </p>
